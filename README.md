# Py2JVM
## Introduction
This project uses the CPython `ast` module to compile source Python to the JVM!
This was initially designed for use with Python 3.10, but I am attempting to make
it relatively simpler to implement different backends for different versions and
implementations!

## Motivation
This project was created with inspiration from [Transcrypt](https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt),
which does a similar thing with Python to JavaScript!
